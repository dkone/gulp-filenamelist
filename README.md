# Installation

Install package with NPM and add it to your dependencies:

`npm install --save gulp-filenamelist`

# Usage

## Default behaviour

By default this plugin creates a file called `filenamelist.txt`, containing a
comma separated list of the supplied files including their extension.

```js
var filenamelist = require('gulp-filenamelist');

gulp.task('scripts', function() {
  return gulp.src('./icons/*.svg')
    .pipe(filenamelist())
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/'));
});
```

Assuming these files are passed in:

```
files
├── a.txt
└── b.txt
```

A file called `filenamelist.txt` would be output containing:

```
a.txt,b.txt
```

## Sass file example

To create a file that that could be used as a list of variables that could then
be imported in a Sass file:

```js
var filenamelist = require('gulp-filenamelist');

var opts = {
    outputFileName: 'iconnames.scss',
    stripExt: true,
    prepend: '$icons: (\n\t',
    append: ');',
    separator: ',\n\t'
}

gulp.task('scripts', function() {
  return gulp.src('./icons/*.svg')
    .pipe(filenamelist(opts))
    .pipe(gulp.dest('./dist/'));
});
```

Assuming these files are passed in:

```
files
├── mail.svg
└── phone.svg
```

A file called `iconnames.scss` will be generated, containing:

```
$icons: (
    mail,
    phone
);
```
